We designed our library to be easy to implement in your code as you see in this example:

```swift
import FlyveMDMInventory

let inventoryTask = InventoryTask()
inventoryTask.execute("Agent_v1.0", tag:"1.0") { result in
    print(result)
}
```

Also you can see more of it, in the Example folder in the repository of the project, see [iOS Inventory Library Example](https://github.com/flyve-mdm/ios-inventory-library/tree/develop/Example)
